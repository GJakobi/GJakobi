## Hi there üèä‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## About me
I'm passionate about problem-solving and computer science stuff. Experience developing scalable software using modern technologies. Capable of learning new concepts quickly and using them to generate value. I work mainly with NodeJS, SQL, and Typescript, but I like to study C/C++ and other programming-related things as a hobby. Also, I really like swimming.

Please note that my GitHub is not very active as I primarily use GitLab for my professional work at my company, check my [profile](https://gitlab.com/GJakobi) there.

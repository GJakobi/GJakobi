## Hi there 🏊‍♂️

_Veni, Vidi, Codici Fixi._ - "I came, I saw, I fixed the code."

## About me
I'm passionate about problem-solving and computer science stuff. Experience developing scalable software using modern technologies. Capable of learning new concepts quickly and using them to generate value. I work mainly with NodeJS, SQL, and Typescript, but I like to study C/C++ and other programming-related things as a hobby. Also, I really like swimming.
